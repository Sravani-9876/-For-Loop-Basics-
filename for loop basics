        print(i)



22)Given a sentence "Python is fun", print each word separately:
sentence = "Python is fun"
words = sentence.split() 
for word in words:
    print(word)



23)Calculate the factorial of a given number (e.g., 6!) using a for loop:
n= 6  
factorial = 1  
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i  
print(factorial) 


24)Given a list [3, 6, 9, 12], create a new list where each element is squared:
list = [3, 6, 9, 12]
s = []
for x in list:
    s.append(x ** 2)
print(s)


25)Given a list of numbers, print only the numbers that are greater than 50:
